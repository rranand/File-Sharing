Welcome back this lesson we're going to be learning how to install some of the programs required to

00:05.010 --> 00:10.770
use my school as well as some we're just going to be using in this lesson the first two we're going

00:10.770 --> 00:15.060
to install our my ask itself so be my admin.

00:15.420 --> 00:20.350
Fortunately we can get both of these in a single package called Zant.

00:20.550 --> 00:25.440
If you go to the link provided you will come to this page.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.250
We could sign and was Facebook or Google.

00:27.260 --> 00:32.240
But Azziz is issues the alternative download which will take you to this page.

00:32.420 --> 00:38.330
You'll quickly have a pop up which will ask you to sign up now click say we could watch their installation

00:38.330 --> 00:40.170
video but I'll explain everything.

00:41.620 --> 00:47.320
Now as you say this is downloading we're going to cut a little bit out here to save some time.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.190
Now that it's all downloaded we just have to open a file and it'll ask us to run it.

00:55.550 --> 01:01.850
You may get a little pop up that warns about possible slowing down of the installation due to an anti-virus

01:02.210 --> 01:03.890
but it doesn't really have much of an effect.

01:03.890 --> 01:08.880
So just click yes then you will click next.

01:09.470 --> 01:13.430
And in here we don't really need most of these things we're just looking for my ask.

01:13.460 --> 01:22.590
Well so we're going to check all these Remember we also want to get BHB madman.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.890
We're going to click next and you can select the installation folder by default.

01:27.900 --> 01:34.640
It's just cÃ©zanne don't have to click to learn anything more so what's.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.540
Now you're ready to install packaging.

01:38.930 --> 01:41.870
And once again we're going to cut to the end the.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.370
One says loaded.

01:44.390 --> 01:46.310
It'll take you to the finished page.

01:46.310 --> 01:52.540
And yes we're going to go ahead and launch the control panel that will ask us to choose our language

01:54.770 --> 01:58.000
and then you're going to see this easy to navigate panel.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.090
Let's go ahead and start apache at my school.

02:02.300 --> 02:02.840
That's it.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.740
We actually have the prep work for a database already.

02:06.740 --> 02:13.580
And not only that because we install BHP might mean we have a way to see it to PH.

02:13.600 --> 02:22.340
My opinion simply go back to your browser and type localhost BHP my admin that'll bring you up to an

02:22.340 --> 02:27.650
interface where you can see that we now have Manusky Rayle installed and some test databases that come

02:27.650 --> 02:29.690
to on the system.

02:29.690 --> 02:31.970
We're not going to go into actually using this just yet.

02:32.090 --> 02:34.170
This is just the way to go.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.200
We'll move on to the next thing.

02:36.740 --> 02:41.390
If you're not using Windows then the installation instructions provided are ready.

02:41.470 --> 02:48.650
They don't tell you all you need to know for example if you're on a Mac you can use the download location

02:48.650 --> 02:52.490
I provided and pick one after downloading.

02:52.490 --> 02:56.470
Just open the downloadable should be nice the same as I listed here.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.680
Drag and drop the zent browser into your applications folder.

02:59.680 --> 03:05.960
That's a complete installation and then to start Csound simply open the Zant control by going to slash

03:05.960 --> 03:12.700
applications slash sale sign up in your control Haunter and from there you can start apache minuscule

03:13.860 --> 03:14.630
paralytics.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.980
Then you will need to use this location for download after downloading.

03:18.990 --> 03:23.040
You're going to need to change your permission love the file so that it can be executed.

03:23.110 --> 03:29.490
I provided the command to do that here and figure 2 way after that run the installer.

03:29.490 --> 03:32.400
The command for that is in 3A.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.860
Once it's running you can just follow the process to install.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.760
It should be just like the Windows version.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.660
After installation to start zone.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.660
Enter sudo slash slash slash way up.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.120
