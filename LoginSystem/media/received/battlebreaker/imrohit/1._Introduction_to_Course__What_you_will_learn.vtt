Hello and welcome to learn my ask you owl with Justin Posey brought to you by KRAD of online school

00:05.880 --> 00:09.440
dot com a little bit about me.

00:09.670 --> 00:15.490
I have known years and web development and my specialization has been in my school LMP HP.

00:15.890 --> 00:21.300
There are other courses available online school dot com and it's a Tauriel.

00:21.320 --> 00:27.850
We're going to go over a basic introduction of mine as to how to install Maia's Cuil server DHV mad

00:27.860 --> 00:34.700
man and Mariscal where change we're going to teach you how to create databases tables how to import

00:34.720 --> 00:42.020
and export information from those tables how to input retrieve and manipulate data with ASCII well and

00:42.020 --> 00:46.780
some more advanced as you take names for those who want to get the most out of the system.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.670
Well let's get started then.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.100
First a quick aside about pronunciation as you can tell I've been calling it my.

00:53.110 --> 00:55.970
Q Well that is the correct pronunciation.

00:56.030 --> 00:58.920
However it is also commonly called sequel.

00:58.940 --> 00:59.840
We hear it called that.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.780
Don't be confused.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.610
It's the same thing.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.070
So what is my ask.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.960
Well my ask you will is a relational database management system for RDBMS.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.720
According to a poll by.

01:11.960 --> 01:17.420
Around 90 percent of the 300 companies polled actively use the systems in their businesses.

01:17.420 --> 01:24.180
So as you can see the RDBMS does play an important role for almost every company Maskey well is one

01:24.180 --> 01:30.300
of the most widely used of the RDBMS in the world according to the same poll Forty one percent of the

01:30.300 --> 01:34.670
companies were using bascule putting it in the top three along with Oracle.

01:34.690 --> 01:38.700
The Microsoft rescue Sarber Sadow that we know it's important.

01:38.700 --> 01:43.130
The next question is just what is a relational database management system.

01:43.650 --> 01:45.610
Let's break it up into two parts.

01:45.660 --> 01:51.060
First the database management system is simply a system designed to allow you to store and retrieve

01:51.060 --> 01:53.360
information from a database.

01:53.490 --> 01:59.100
For example let's say you wanted to store a list of reservations a database management system would

01:59.100 --> 02:04.320
allow you to put that information into a database and it would store for you and keep it available so

02:04.320 --> 02:07.270
that you could retrieve that data at any time.

02:07.290 --> 02:14.100
However you can either pull out what you put in now relational database management system does the same

02:14.100 --> 02:19.920
thing but it uses a particular structure for storing the data called the relational model.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.160
This model allows different pieces of information to connect to each other in a meaningful way.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.820
For example if you look at the image on the right you can see that there are two different sections

02:29.820 --> 02:30.850
of information.

02:31.140 --> 02:37.240
But despite these being stored separately you can per day use a combined section of the information.

02:37.350 --> 02:41.190
This is possible because both sets of information have something in common.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.910
The activity code that commonality is what relates to them and storing the information with those commonalities

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
is what makes the database relational.

02:52.030 --> 02:57.970
So how does Mayank Who else can retrieve data or uses something called the client server mom.

02:58.070 --> 03:04.400
In this model the database typically resides on a server that is accessed via client through the Internet.

03:04.400 --> 03:11.360
A client can be an interface for direct manipulations such as ph being mad madman or it can even be

03:11.450 --> 03:17.170
a web site application or program which operates behind the scenes.

03:17.230 --> 03:22.930
Now that we know what a client is let's talk about how a clock communicates with the server to do this.

03:22.990 --> 03:28.450
Is this something taught at Escudo where structured query language this language can be used to define

03:28.540 --> 03:35.140
update inquiry the database query is just a time from the set of instructions seems like any language

03:35.270 --> 03:41.500
bascule has a specific set of syntaxes that once sent from the client to the server can then be interpreted

03:41.500 --> 03:46.830
by Maia's well so that it can take the appropriate action on the database.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.950
A quick example of this syntax would be something like.

03:50.170 --> 03:53.600
Select name from person where age equals 21.

03:54.010 --> 04:00.940
We'll get into the actual syntax later in the course but for now that's how it looks and the best part

04:00.940 --> 04:05.620
is that Cuil is used by virtually all relational database systems.

04:05.890 --> 04:10.980
So you can use the same set of instructions no matter what your environment is.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.950
That's it for the introduction and the next video.

04:13.990 --> 04:17.430
We will go over the different types of data that can be stored within Myskina.
